> üç¨ Customizable and extendable theming dictionary for Styled Components.

![demo](/graphics/demo.gif?raw=true)

- Create **more flexible designs** with React and Styled Components.
- **Pre-built design system** that works across all your projects.
- **Focus on design**, not variables.

## Installation:
```
yarn add @roast-cms/react-sugar-styled
```
Then, in your project:
```javascript
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components"
import { Sugar } from "@roast-cms/react-sugar-styled"
//
// you can access the dictionary values from Styled Components within
// any component that's wrapped in <ThemeProvider />
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${props => props.theme.color.brand()};
`
//
// pass the dictionary Sugar() as a theme to your app:
const App = props =>
  <ThemeProvider theme={Sugar()}><MyComponent /></ThemeProvider>
```

## Why?
[Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) lets you apply CSS to your React components with ease. Their [theming support](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) adds a level of flexibility and organization to your application. You can make your components visually behave in an organized fashion, while remaining independent.

Theming in this context works as defining a dictionary of values which could be reused across the children components. **However**, what those values are is a mystery until you finish building your project.

`react-sugar-styled` provides you with a set of defaults that you can easily customize and extend. They include basics like colours, fonts, key sizes, and more. A set of convenience functions also helps you with responsive design (breakpoints), as well as size and colour modifications.

## Theme globals.
All of the values in the theme object are accessible across all your components which are children of `<ThemeProvider/>`. Here's what they do and how to access them:

To access a value within your CSS (that you wrote with Styled Components) simply include `${props => props.theme.[OBJECT REFERENCE]}`, where **OBJECT REFERENCE** is one of the following:

#### Colours

**OBJECT REFERENCE** | Description | Usage Example
--- | --- | ---
`color.brand(alpha)` | An rgba value for your "special" theme colour. | `color: ${props => props.theme.color.brand()};`
`color.foreground(alpha)` | An rgba value for your foreground colour, typically the colour of your body text. | `color: ${props => props.theme.color.foreground()};`
`color.background(alpha)` | An rgba value for your background colour, typically the colour of your background. | `background: ${props => props.theme.color.background()};`

#### Typography

**OBJECT REFERENCE** | Description | Usage Example
--- | --- | ---
`typography.title.auto` | Return CSS that sets `color`, `font-family`, `letter-spacing`, `line-height`, `font-weight`, and `margin` designed for title/heading tags. | `h1 { ${props => props.theme.typography.title.auto} }`
`typography.text.auto` | Same as above, but for body text. | `p { ${props => props.theme.typography.text.auto} }`

#### Block measuring sizes
**OBJECT REFERENCE** | Description | Usage Example
--- | --- | ---
`size.block.padding` | Returns a number meant to be used as `em` value for standard padding width | `padding: ${props => props.theme.size.block.padding}em;`
`size.block.padding` | Returns a number meant to be used as `em` value for standard spacing between blocks | `margin: ${props => props.theme.size.block.spacing}em;`
`size.block.border` | Returns a number meant to be used as `px` value for standard border widths | `border: ${props => props.theme.size.block.border}px solid;`
`size.block.column.m` | Returns a number meant to be used as `px` value for a medium-width content column | `article { width: ${props => props.theme.size.column.m} }`
`size.block.column.l` | Same as above, but for wider screens | `article { width: ${props => props.theme.size.column.l} }`

## Customizing & extending the theme.
Although you can immediately start designing your components using the default theme dictionary, you may want to customize it. Luckily there's an easy way to do this:

```javascript
<ThemeProvider
  theme={Sugar({
      color_brand: "rgb(189,67,54)",
      color_background: "rgb(44,44,44)",
      color_foreground: "rgb(224,213,255)",
      //
      font_heading: "'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif",
      font_heading_weight: 400,
      //
      font_body: "'Lobster Two', serif",
      //
      size_base: 28,
      size_column_medium: 700,
      size_column_large: 900,
      size_block_padding: 2,
      size_block_spacing: 1.5,
      size_block_border: 10,
      //
      effects_border_radius: 1
    })
  }
>
{/* components */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

You can also extend the theme with your own dictionary values or system using ES6 spread operator:

```javascript
<ThemeProvider
  theme={{
    ...Sugar(),
    font_special: "'Indie Flower', cursive"
  }}
>
{/* components */}
</ThemeProvider>
```
